# ionic-notes-app
Simple Note taking application made in Ionic and Angular, this is a pretty simple project and a great head start for people wanting to learn about ionic app development.


In this app, I've used Ionic for the app to bve easily devleoped for android and ios platform, and angular as the framework to develop the front end ui of the app.
There is no backend for the app, this app is entirely based on the front end logic and I've used local storage for saving and accessing the notes and to display the exisiting notes from the memory.
